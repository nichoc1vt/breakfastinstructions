## Ground Rules

-   When cooking with the stovetop, be sure to turn on the fumehood vent
    fan with the switch at eye level. Turn off when you have finished
    cooking.

-   After you have finished cooking, wash each dish and utensil with
    dish soap and return it to the place in which it was found.

-   Likewise, after cooking, return all ingredients to the places in
    which they were found. Meats found in sealed containers should be
    removed using a chef's knife, which should then be washed. Unused
    meats should then be placed in a sealable plastic bag, found in the
    drawer to the left of the refrigerator.

-   After cooking, wait until "hot surface" light on electric stovetop
    has turned off; then, wipe clean stovetop with disinfecting wipes
    available in container on the counter.
